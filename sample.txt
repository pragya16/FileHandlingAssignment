First to create a new file you need to use the built-in function open().
The open function accepts the file name and mode w as the parameters.  
You can pass therelative or absolute path to the open() function. 
If you pass a relative path, the file in the current working directory is processed. 
Mode w indicates that the file is created if it does not exist otherwise the file content will be erased. 
The open() function returns a file object to allow to have further manipulation.
##Second to write text into a text file you method write() of the file object. 
You can write a single line or multiple lines of texts as a string into a text file. 
To write a new line to a file you need explicitly add end-of-line character \n to string.
##Third, you must close the file to finalize file contents and free up system resources by using method close() of the file object.
